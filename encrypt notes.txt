verify password
- have hashed version of password in db
- take what user entered, hash it, see if it
  matches

- do the encrypt plus also the salt!

*** should be usr and pass_HASH

syntax for HASHBYTES is:
--- HASHBYTES('hash_algo', password)

can declare the random salt with:
---- salt UNIQUEIDENTIFIER=NEWID()
---- then insert with hash and salt
     >>> HASHBYTES('hash_algo' pass+CAST(salt as
                   NVARCHAR(36))
     *** the salt must be an extra param

in order to check with encrypt and hash:
--- hash = HASHBYTES('hash_func', pass+CAST(Salt 
                     as NVARCHAR(36)) 
    >>> recall: salt is a field in the table now

also, we now want to use nvar chars
